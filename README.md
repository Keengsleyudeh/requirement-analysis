## ðŸŽ¯ Use Case Diagrams

### What Are Use Case Diagrams?

**Use Case Diagrams** are a type of behavioral diagram defined by UML (Unified Modeling Language) that visually represent the functional requirements of a system. They illustrate how users (actors) interact with the system to achieve specific goals (use cases). These diagrams provide a high-level overview of system functionalities and user interactions.

### Benefits of Use Case Diagrams

- **Clarity:** They help stakeholders understand system functionality from a user perspective.
- **Communication:** They serve as an effective communication tool between technical and non-technical team members.
- **Scope Management:** They help define system boundaries and identify all possible interactions.
- **Requirement Validation:** They assist in validating that all user expectations are captured in the system.
