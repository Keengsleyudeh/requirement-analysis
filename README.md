# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository serves as a structured documentation hub for the **Requirement Analysis Project**, part of the ALX Software Engineering curriculum.

## ðŸ“Œ Purpose

The goal of this repository is to simulate a real-world software development scenario by thoroughly analyzing, documenting, and structuring requirements for a **Booking Management System**. It captures the foundational phase of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) â€” Requirement Analysis â€” and translates project needs into clear, actionable documentation.

Through a series of tasks, this repository will include:

- Functional and non-functional requirements
- Use case definitions and diagrams
- User stories and acceptance criteria
- Visual representations of system actors and interactions

This documentation is aimed at fostering clarity, alignment with business goals, and readiness for seamless development execution.
