# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository serves as a structured documentation hub for the **Requirement Analysis Project**, part of the ALX Software Engineering curriculum.

## üìå Purpose

The goal of this repository is to simulate a real-world software development scenario by thoroughly analyzing, documenting, and structuring requirements for a **Booking Management System**. It captures the foundational phase of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) ‚Äî Requirement Analysis ‚Äî and translates project needs into clear, actionable documentation.

Through a series of tasks, this repository will include:

- Functional and non-functional requirements  
- Use case definitions and diagrams  
- User stories and acceptance criteria  
- Visual representations of system actors and interactions  

This documentation is aimed at fostering clarity, alignment with business goals, and readiness for seamless development execution.

## üìñ What is Requirement Analysis?

**Requirement Analysis** is the process of identifying, gathering, and documenting the functional and non-functional needs of a system. It is a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) that serves as the blueprint for all subsequent design, development, and testing activities.

During this phase, developers, analysts, and stakeholders work collaboratively to ensure that the software solution being developed aligns with business objectives and user expectations. It involves:

- Understanding the problem domain  
- Identifying stakeholders and system users  
- Defining what the system should do (functional requirements)  
- Specifying performance, usability, and security expectations (non-functional requirements)  
- Creating diagrams and models to visualize system behavior and interactions  

Effective requirement analysis reduces ambiguity, minimizes costly revisions later in the project, and significantly increases the chances of delivering a successful software solution.

## üí° Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement analysis is a cornerstone of the software development process, offering several key benefits that directly contribute to the success of a project. Here are three reasons why it's so critical in the SDLC:

### 1. **Ensures Clear Understanding of Stakeholder Needs**

Requirement analysis ensures that the needs and expectations of all stakeholders (business owners, end users, developers, etc.) are fully understood and documented. It prevents misunderstandings and ensures that everyone involved is aligned with the project‚Äôs goals and scope. Without proper analysis, the software may not meet the expectations of those who need it most, leading to frustration, costly rework, or even project failure.

### 2. **Reduces Risks and Uncertainty**

By identifying potential risks early in the process, requirement analysis helps mitigate uncertainties that could arise during later phases of development. By clarifying what is expected from the software system, developers are able to foresee challenges and plan appropriately. A detailed understanding of the requirements enables more accurate time and resource estimation, preventing surprises during the build phase.

### 3. **Improves Project Efficiency and Cost-Effectiveness**

A well-executed requirement analysis phase helps reduce costly changes later in the project. When requirements are thoroughly defined upfront, developers are less likely to make mistakes or overlook critical features during development. It also facilitates a smoother transition from design to development by providing a clear and comprehensive foundation, allowing teams to work more efficiently and with greater confidence.

## üìù Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

The requirement analysis phase involves several key activities that help ensure the software is built according to the needs of the users and stakeholders. Here are the five primary activities:

### 1. **Requirement Gathering**
   - This is the initial phase where information about the software system is collected from various stakeholders, including business owners, users, and technical teams.
   - Key methods include interviews, surveys, and workshops.

### 2. **Requirement Elicitation**
   - In this phase, the gathered requirements are clarified and refined through interactions with stakeholders to ensure accuracy.
   - It often involves discussions, brainstorming sessions, and reviews to uncover hidden or implicit requirements.

### 3. **Requirement Documentation**
   - After gathering and refining the requirements, they need to be formally documented.
   - This includes creating clear, structured documents such as requirement specifications, use case diagrams, and acceptance criteria, which will guide development.

### 4. **Requirement Analysis and Modeling**
   - Here, the documented requirements are analyzed to ensure consistency, feasibility, and alignment with business goals.
   - This phase often includes creating models (such as UML diagrams) to visualize system behavior and interaction.

### 5. **Requirement Validation**
   - This activity ensures that the documented requirements meet the needs of the stakeholders and align with the project‚Äôs business objectives.
   - Validation is typically done through reviews, inspections, and user feedback to ensure the requirements are correct and complete.

## üîë Types of Requirements

In any software development project, including the **Booking Management System**, requirements are typically classified into two types: **Functional Requirements** and **Non-Functional Requirements**. These serve different purposes and guide various aspects of system development.

### Functional Requirements

Functional requirements describe what the system should do, focusing on the functionality of the system. They outline the features, services, and behaviors that the software must provide.

**Examples for Booking Management System:**
- The system must allow users to search for available rooms by date and location.
- The system must allow users to make, modify, and cancel bookings.
- The system must send email confirmations to users upon booking or cancellation.
- The system must allow users to view their booking history and details.

### Non-Functional Requirements

Non-functional requirements define the quality attributes, performance, and constraints of the system, ensuring it operates smoothly and meets user expectations for performance, security, and usability.

**Examples for Booking Management System:**
- **Performance:** The system must be able to handle 500 concurrent users without degradation in performance.
- **Security:** The system must ensure all user data is encrypted and follow industry standards for data privacy.
- **Usability:** The system must have an intuitive interface, allowing users to complete a booking in under 5 minutes.
- **Scalability:** The system must be able to scale horizontally to accommodate increasing user traffic as the business grows.
