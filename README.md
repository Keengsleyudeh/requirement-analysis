## ðŸŽ¯ Use Case Diagrams

### What Are Use Case Diagrams?

**Use Case Diagrams** are a type of behavioral diagram defined by UML (Unified Modeling Language) that visually represent the functional requirements of a system. They illustrate how users (actors) interact with the system to achieve specific goals (use cases). These diagrams provide a high-level overview of system functionalities and user interactions.

### Benefits of Use Case Diagrams

- **Clarity:** They help stakeholders understand system functionality from a user perspective.
- **Communication:** They serve as an effective communication tool between technical and non-technical team members.
- **Scope Management:** They help define system boundaries and identify all possible interactions.
- **Requirement Validation:** They assist in validating that all user expectations are captured in the system.

## âœ… Acceptance Criteria

### Importance of Acceptance Criteria in Requirement Analysis

Acceptance Criteria are conditions that a software product must satisfy to be accepted by a user, customer, or other stakeholders. They define the boundaries of a user story or feature and ensure that everyone involved in the project has a shared understanding of the expected outcome.

**Why Acceptance Criteria Matter:**
- ðŸ§­ **Clarity:** They provide clear and measurable expectations for what a feature should do.
- ðŸ§ª **Testability:** They serve as the basis for test cases and QA validation.
- ðŸ”„ **Alignment:** They help developers, testers, and stakeholders stay aligned on the scope and functionality.
- ðŸ“¦ **Deliverability:** They ensure that features meet user needs before being marked as complete.

### Example: Acceptance Criteria for Checkout Feature

**Feature:** Checkout for Booking Management System

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- âœ… The user must be able to view a summary of their booking, including dates, room type, and total cost.
- âœ… The system must support secure payment through the integrated Payment Gateway.
- âœ… The booking is only confirmed after successful payment authorization.
- âœ… A booking confirmation email must be sent to the user immediately after successful checkout.
- âœ… If the payment fails, the user must be notified with an appropriate error message and allowed to retry.
- âœ… The system must update room availability after a successful checkout to prevent overbooking.

These criteria help ensure the Checkout feature delivers value, works as expected, and aligns with the business goals.
