# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository serves as a structured documentation hub for the **Requirement Analysis Project**, part of the ALX Software Engineering curriculum.

## ðŸ“Œ Purpose

The goal of this repository is to simulate a real-world software development scenario by thoroughly analyzing, documenting, and structuring requirements for a **Booking Management System**. It captures the foundational phase of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) â€” Requirement Analysis â€” and translates project needs into clear, actionable documentation.

Through a series of tasks, this repository will include:

- Functional and non-functional requirements  
- Use case definitions and diagrams  
- User stories and acceptance criteria  
- Visual representations of system actors and interactions  

This documentation is aimed at fostering clarity, alignment with business goals, and readiness for seamless development execution.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

**Requirement Analysis** is the process of identifying, gathering, and documenting the functional and non-functional needs of a system. It is a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) that serves as the blueprint for all subsequent design, development, and testing activities.

During this phase, developers, analysts, and stakeholders work collaboratively to ensure that the software solution being developed aligns with business objectives and user expectations. It involves:

- Understanding the problem domain  
- Identifying stakeholders and system users  
- Defining what the system should do (functional requirements)  
- Specifying performance, usability, and security expectations (non-functional requirements)  
- Creating diagrams and models to visualize system behavior and interactions  

Effective requirement analysis reduces ambiguity, minimizes costly revisions later in the project, and significantly increases the chances of delivering a successful software solution.
